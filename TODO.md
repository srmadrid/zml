# To Do

Make a `<object>FromExpression` function. For instance, if I want to create the product of a set (`S\times S`), then I can use setFromExpression(...). An Set.cartesian(null, &[_]*Set{&S, &S}), returns the set of cartesian product with "S \times S" as the default name (null was passed instead of a string).
